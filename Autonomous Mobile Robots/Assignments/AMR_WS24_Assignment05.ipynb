    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will use a Kalman filter for localisation in an environment based on the measurement of landmark locations. As you already know, sensor readings are affected by noise, making it difficult to achieve accurate measurement of the physical quantity under consideration. The Kalman filter, which belongs to the family of Bayes filter algorithms, can be used for minimising the error in the estimation. The belief of the state (in this case, it is the **pose of the robot** with respect to the **map frame**) is represented as a Gaussian distribution. The objective is to estimate the mean $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ for the physical quantity under consideration at every time instance."

    "In this assignment, the Robile is placed in a simulation environment in Gazebo, where several RFID tags are positioned on the ground. Now, suppose that a virtual RFID detector is mounted on the robot, sharing the *same frame* and *field of view* as the LiDAR. In the real world, the robot's real pose almost never matches with its ideal motion model due to different sources of noise, such as from the encoder readings, unstructured environment interaction, as well as other noisy perception data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore how the Kalman filter can be employed to improve the estimation of the robot's pose in this setup. Below is the simulation environment where the RFID tags are highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![robile_localisation_kalman](img/robile_localisation_kalman.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of the RFID tags as $(x,y)$ coordinates in the `odom` frame with tag names are as follows:  \n",
    "- A: $(1.0, 1.0)$\n",
    "- B: $(6.0, 1.0)$\n",
    "- C: $(3.0, -1.0)$\n",
    "- D: $(1.0, -3.0)$\n",
    "- E: $(4.0, -4.0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion noise consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "When the robot is moving in the environment, the noise in the data published onto the `/odom` topic is negligible in the simulation. To simulate the real-world noise, for every message on the `/odom` topic, some noise is introduced manually in the associated *robile_rfid_tag_finder.py* script, and the variable `real_base_link_pose` is updated accordingly. Here, the data on the `/odom` topic, and consequently the visualization of the robot model in RVIZ, can be considered as an ideal motion model, which is the motion estimate without noise; the data on `real_base_link_pose` is then the actual pose of the robot's base (`real_base_link` frame) with respect to which the RFID tags are measured, and which are available on the `/rfid_tag_poses` topic. The `real_base_link_pose` topic thus represents the actual pose of the robot, which deviates from `/odom` due to uncertain interaction with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to read from the `odom` topic and, along with the measured RFID tag positions, estimate the posterior belief of the robot's pose and the variance associated with it. This estimated pose, which should be published to the `estimated_base_link_pose` topic, should eventually converge to the pose represented on `real_laser_link_pose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pose of the robot with respect to the odom frame, published on the `/odom` topic represents ideal motion without noise.\n",
    "- Since it is challenging to mathematically represent or model all physical interactions with the environment, in reality, the robot deviates from the ideal motion and its pose estimation is affected by noise in the sensor data and an incomplete model of the interaction with the environment. The actual robot pose is considered to be the `real_base_link` frame.\n",
    "- The measurement model is the pose estimate using the detected RFID tags on the `/rfid_tag_poses` topic, which is represented by a custom message of type ``PoseLabelledArray``. These tags are measured with respect to the `real_base_link` frame.\n",
    "- Note that the `real_base_link` frame is only used to visualise the actual robot pose; thus, only the data on `/odom` and `/rfid_tag_poses` topics should be used to determine robot's posterior pose `estimated_base_link_pose`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial `real_base_link` frame is considered to be overlapping with the `odom` frame.\n",
    "- To determine the robot's pose by the measurement of RFID tag positions, at least two tags needs to be perceived. The problem could be made simpler by considering the pose estimated using these RFID positions as measurement data rather than the measured RFID positions themselves.\n",
    "- The initial state, i.e., the `estimated_base_link_pose` pose at the start of simulation is considered the same as the pose of the `odom` frame, namely `estimated_base_link_pose` can be considered as initially known with zero or constant uncertainty. Optionally, it can be updated using the `2D Pose Estimate` widget in RVIZ, in which case the mean and variance of the estimate should be reset.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload the modified `robile_navigation` package with your submission, and also paste your Kalman filter implementation in the cell below. Before starting your implementation please follow these steps:\n",
